Donation incentives

- Each game will have an overall total. We can use date and time info for rafells.
- Donation incentives will not be selectable on this iteration of the marathon, but instead contributed to as a total

Incentive ideas:

- Alcohol
- Limiting gameplay
- Find more things in the game
- Race limitations as well
- One thing or the other incentive
    - Could just use donation messages to contribute.
- 

Code:

- Check for updates to total during game
- If the donor and amount are updated, then change the donation total
- Use a gui so that you only have to change the game name
- Show the upcoming incentive on stream.

- Use API to check which game is being streamed
- Use API to check for incoming donation
- Store the dollar amount going to each game?
